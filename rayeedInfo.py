about_me = "I am Rayeed Zaman, an international student at Georgia Tech, majoring in Computer Science. With a strong background in Python, React, Node, Express, and Flask, I have developed a variety of full-stack applications, including my AI app called AquaRoute, aimed at optimizing ocean route planning to reduce plastic pollution, which won the best use of DataBricks at the AI ATL Hackathon. As the Head of IT at Asha Bangladesh, I have led teams of developers in leveraging GitHub for collaboration, while also contributing to the organization‚Äôs broader goals. I‚Äôm also passionate about outreach and currently serve as the Head of Outreach at Crisis Brigade. Outside of my professional responsibilities, I love to play the guitar and hang out with my friends. I make songs for fun sometimes and I also found myself making a recipe app for this project because I love food! "
