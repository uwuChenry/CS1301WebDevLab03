about_me = "Hi, I am Henry Chen, and I am an undergrad student at the Georgia Institute of Technology majoring in Computer Engineering. For eight years, I have participated in robotics competitions and gained extensive experience in designing robots and developing robotics algorithms for time-critical systems. In addition, I have honed my skills in leadership, teamwork, project management, event organization and mentoring. Providing educational opportunities for robotics in New Zealand has been a mission for me due to the lack of resources when I was starting out. I founded Skywalker Robotics in 2019 to create a place for passionate students that wanted to improve their skills in robotics through a variety of different robotic competitions such as FLL, VRC and Vex IQ. Outside of Skywalker Robotics. Throughout the years, I've found my passion for robotics and I hope to continue pursuing my passion for my career in fields such as planning, controls, computer vision as well as low level programming and embedded systems. Feel free to contact me at pchen432@gatech.edu. I look forward to meeting passionate like-minded peers and professionals."
